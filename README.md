## ü§î Reflections & Potential Improvements

* **Data Validation:** Upon review, some data points like "Best Average" and "Best StrikeRate" being attributed to RG Sharma in the bowling dashboard seem anomalous, as he is primarily a batsman. A future version would involve a more rigorous data cleaning step to ensure role-specific metrics are correctly assigned.
* **Advanced Analytics:** Implement drill-through features to allow users to click on a player and see a detailed page of all their specific stats.
* **Player Comparison:** Add a feature to select two players and compare their tournament statistics side-by-side.
